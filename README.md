# Genomic prediction of within and among biparental families of oat

This repository contains code and information associated with "Genomic prediction of seed nutritional traits in biparental families of oat (Avena sativa)". 

<i> Genomic prediction, across biparental families from germplasm panel: </i> In this work, genomic prediction was conducted across biparental families (e.g., prediction of family mean) using different germplasm panels as a training population

<i> Genomic prediction, within biparental families from germplasm panel: </i> Within family genomic prediciton accuracy was assessed for multiple biparental families using different germplasm panels as a training population

<i> Genomic prediction, within biparental families from other families: </i> Within family genomic prediciton accuracy was assessed for multiple biparental families using different other families as a training population (e.g., for <i>n</i> families, <i>n-1</i> families are used to train a genomic prediciton model to predict within the <i>nth</i> family).

<i> Optimization of germplasm panel as a training population: </i> A sparse selection index was implemented in the germplasm panel from code provided in the supplemental material of Lopez-Cruz, M., Beyene, Y., Gowda, M. et al. Multi-generation genomic prediction of maize yield using parametric and non-parametric sparse selection indices. Heredity 127, 423–432 (2021).

<i> Optimization of families as a training population: </i> Optimized training sets from families was implemented with CDpop in code provided in the supplemental material of Rincent, R., Charcosset, A. & Moreau, L. Predicting genomic selection efficiency to optimize calibration set and to assess prediction accuracy in highly structured populations. Theor Appl Genet 130, 2231–2247 (2017).
