This repository contains code and information associated with "Genomic prediction of seed nutritional traits in biparental families of oat (Avena sativa)". 

<i> Genomic prediction, across biparental families from germplasm panel: </i> In this work, genomic prediction was conducted across biparental families (e.g., prediction of family mean) using different germplasm panels as a training population

<i> Genomic prediction, within biparental families from germplasm panel: </i> Within family genomic prediciton accuracy was assessed for multiple biparental families using different germplasm panels as a training population

<i> Genomic prediction, within biparental families from other families: </i> Within family genomic prediciton accuracy was assessed for multiple biparental families using different other families as a training population (e.g., for <i>n</i> families, <i>n-1</i> families are used to train a genomic prediciton model to predict within the <i>nth</i> family).

<i> Optimization of germplasm panel as a training population: </i> A sparse selection index was implemented in the germplasm panel from code provided in the supplemental material of Lopez-Cruz, M., Beyene, Y., Gowda, M. et al. Multi-generation genomic prediction of maize yield using parametric and non-parametric sparse selection indices. Heredity 127, 423–432 (2021).

<i> Optimization of families as a training population: </i> Optimized training sets from families was implemented with CDpop in code provided in the supplemental material of Rincent, R., Charcosset, A. & Moreau, L. Predicting genomic selection efficiency to optimize calibration set and to assess prediction accuracy in highly structured populations. Theor Appl Genet 130, 2231–2247 (2017).
